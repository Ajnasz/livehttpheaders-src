- Add a Content-Length and Content-Type for POST as they are not available
  Theses two headers are sent to the server but are not available throw the
  mozilla API...

- Add Save button in live header dialog
  Clipboards seem to be limited in size (copy all button) at least on linux

- Detect proxy type (http, https and socks).  Only HTTP proxies gets full URL.
  No proxy and socks have this kind of request: GET /url.html HTTP/1.0
  HTTP proxies have this type: GET http://www.site.com/url.htm HTTP/1.0

- Add epuration
  The headers information is kept as long as the windows is open

- Try to detect same url in two tabs
  If the same URL is loaded in two TABS in the same window, the information 
  about the second URL will update the information about the first one
