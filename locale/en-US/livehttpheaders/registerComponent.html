To be able to display headers information in the PageInfo tab of Mozilla/Firebird, the nsHeaderInfo component must be registered.  This component is found in the file Mozilla/Components/nsHeaderInfo.js.<p>
Normaly, this is done automatically by the LiveHTTPHeaders installation.  However, this doesn't work sometimes.  So you need to follow the steps bellow to force Mozilla/Firebird to found and register it.
<UL>
<LI>Delete the file <code><b>Mozilla/Components/compreg.dat</b></code></LI>
<LI>Delete the file <code><b>Mozilla/Components/xpti.dat</b></code></LI>
</UL>
This two files should be recreated automatically by Mozilla/Firebird at the next start.
